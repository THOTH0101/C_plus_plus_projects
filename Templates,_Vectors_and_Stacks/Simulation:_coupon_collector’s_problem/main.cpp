/*
 * (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon collector is a classic statistic problem with many
 * practical applications. The problem is to pick objects from a set of objects repeatedly and determine
 * how many picks are needed for all the objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the problem
 * is to pick cards from a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed
 * before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck before picking another.
 * Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed to get four cards from each suit and display the
 * four cards picked (it is possible that a card may be picked twice).
