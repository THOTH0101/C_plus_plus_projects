/*
 *  Design a class named Person and its two derived classes named Student and Employee. Make Faculty
 *  and Staff derived classes of Employee. A person has a name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.
 *  A student has a class status (fresh-man, sophomore, junior, or senior). An employee has an office,
 *  salary, and date-hired. Define a class named MyDate that contains the fields year, month, and day.
 *  A faculty member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a title. Define a constant virtual
 *  toString function in the Person class and override it in each class to display the class name and the
 *  personâ€™s name.
 *  Draw the UML diagram for the classes. Implement the classes. Write a test program that creates a Person,
 *  Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and invokes their toString() functions.
